## Observations
1. Majority of the customers are in the 20-24 age range and though they accumulate the most purchases, the customers in the 35-39 age range that tend to spend the most proportionally.
2. The average price for items stocked is $3.05 and only the <10 and 35-39 age brackets spend over the average which suggest that specialised items are targeted for this demographic but not the general market.
3. Although female customers only account for 14.06% of the total customers, they tend to spend more on average than male customers.
